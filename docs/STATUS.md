# Status — living handoff log

Newest session on top. Each entry: what was done, findings with numbers, open
questions, and the exact next session. Write it for someone with zero context.

**Next session: S1** (first look — Class B check, ship types, timezone).

## S0 — Bootstrap — 2026-08-29

**Done:** repo skeleton (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/DATA.md`,
`docs/DECISIONS.md`, `.gitignore`, `scripts/fetch.sh`). Archive layout verified by
enumerating the S3 bucket (1 128 keys, 2006-03 → 2026-08-26).

**Findings:**
- Daily files live either at the bucket root or under `YYYY/` — `fetch.sh`
  handles both.
- Sizes: 2016 month 18.3 GB zip, 2025 day 0.75 GB zip.
- `clickhouse`, `uv`, `node`, `ffmpeg` are installed on the machine.

**Open questions (for S1):** timestamp timezone; decimal separator in
coordinates; Class B presence on disk.

**Started:** download of the minimal set (`2025-07-12`, `2025-07-16`,
`2025-01-15`, `2025-06-14`) — check `ls data/raw/*.ok`.
